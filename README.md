Summary: 
Mr Tech's Renewal and RFQ Tool for MSP's and VAR's is a simple to deploy web package that is easily customizable to your needs.

What it is for:
MrTRRFQT is for MSP renewal technicians who frequently need to repeat similar, tedious tasks. One of those tasks is generating emails to our vendors for renewals. This tool simplifies your request process for multiple vendors with simple and safe standard messaging. 

All you need to change is the emails the form generates before deploying! 

After you deploy, simply enter the customer's Info (Name, Address, EU Contact, etc), the serial number(s) of the device(s) you're requesting, and (if applicable), your vendor account number (Ingram, Synnex, etc.). 

Once you click "Save" it will download an EML file for you to use with all the information already loaded and all you have to do is click send! 

Save hundreds of hours each year today!

To Install:
Simply clone the package and change the emails for the form and make any changes needed to comply with your organizations.

License information:
GNU GPL v3 license, please do not sell/resell commercially. Probably won't be many updates after initial deployment so please be wary and confirm HTML, JSS, CSS, PHP, RUBY, and other software technology versions before attempting to implement with your organization.

I take no responsibility for the misuse or abuse of this software and offer it free of any malware or malicious intent and it's uses are clearly labeled here in this readme. Any additional code added later was done without my knowledge or consent. The code on THIS (github.com/jstacklin/mrtech-renewals-rfq-tool) and only this project is mine. Please clone if you wish to make any changes. 

More Info:
This "app" is not designed to store or maintain data inside the form, however you could easily change it to connect to a database or messaging service through SMTP to send the request automatically. I genuinely just don't have the time or effort right now.
